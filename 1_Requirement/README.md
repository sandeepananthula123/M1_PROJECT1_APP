## Introduction
Snakes and ladders, known originally as Moksha Patam, is an ancient Indian board game for two or more players regarded today as a worldwide classic which is played on a game board with numbered, gridded squares. It is a fun and an intresting game played by all age groups. A number of "snakes" and "ladders" are pictured on the board, each connecting two specefic squares. The objective of the game is to navigate the player's game piece based the output of a die roll, from start to finish. The players comes across many snakes and ladders at different squares. The ladders help the players to climb to a higher numbered square while the snakes decrease to a lower number square. The player who makes it to the last square first wins the game. The program written for this project, although doesn't actually provide a board to play, but uses the same logic for digital implementation of the game, with a maximum of 2 players.


## Equipment
The size of the grid most commonly used in snakes and ladders is 8x8 with maximum square value of 64, 10x10 with a maximum square value of 100 or 12x12 with a maximum square value of 144. Each player is represented by a piece token and a die is rolled to determine the random movements of a player's token.
## History
Snakes and ladders originated in India as part of a family of dice board games. The game made its way to England and was sold as "Snakes and Ladders". Then the basic concept was introduced in the United States as Chutes and Ladders by game publisher Milton Bradley Company in 1943. In India, the game is often played by devotees of Hindu god Vishnu during the Vaikuntha Ekadashi festival in order to stay awake during the night.
